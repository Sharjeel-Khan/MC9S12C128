# Simple IO
In this assignment, we were supposed to spin the motor clockwise and counterclockwise based on button presses. We had programmed four buttons: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Buttons 1 and 2 started the spinning and stopped the spinning respectively. Buttons 3 and 4 were to spin the motor clockwise and counterclockwise. If the motor was already spinning a direction, pressing the button corresponding to the direction would increase the speed. It would increase only two times.
