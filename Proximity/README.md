# Simple IO
In this assignment, we were supposed to make the proximity sensor work with
Analog-to-Digital (ATD) convertor and Pulse Width Modulation (PWM). Based on the proximity of the white paper to the sensor, we supposed to change the color of the light and make the light flash with different intensities.
* Far : Green and slow
* Medium : Blue and fast
* Close : Red and very fast

## Things learned in this homework ##
* How to use Pulse Width Modulation (PWM)
* How to use Analog-to-Digital (ATD) convertor
