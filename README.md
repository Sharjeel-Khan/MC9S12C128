# MC9S12C128
In Spring 2016, I did 15-348 Embedded Systems so these are the assignments in the course. The course had five main assignments :
* SimpleIO
* SimpleIO in Assembly
* Proximity Sensor with Pulse Width Modulation and Analog-to-Digital Conversion
* Keypad with Finite State Machines
* Transmitter and Receiver using Input Capture and Output Capture

We used the MC9S12C128 which is part of Motorola's MC9S12C-Family for the course.

Some features of MC9S12C128:
* 16-bit CPU
* 128 bytes of Flash EEPROM
* 4K of RAM
* Serial Communications Interface (SCI) and Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
* 8-channel, 16-bit timer module
* 6-channel, 8-bit pulse width modulator
* 8-channel, 10-bit analog-to-digital convertor
