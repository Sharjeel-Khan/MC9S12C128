# Assembly Simple IO
In this assignment, we were given two tasks which were to create a transmitter and receiver

## Task 1 ##
We were supposed to read inputs from a Keypad and transmit the string to a receiver. To transmit the string, we used input and output capture.

## Task 2 ##
We were supposed to implement a receiver that receives strings and shows it onto the LCD string.

## Things learned in this homework ##
* How to define a protocol for transmission using SYNC
* How to use Input Capture
* How to use Output Capture
