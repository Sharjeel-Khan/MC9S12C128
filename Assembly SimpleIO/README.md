# Assembly Simple IO
In this assignment, we were given two tasks to do in Assembly.

## Task 1 ##
We were supposed to read the number of times the Button 1 was pressed and show the number using
lights. We had four lights so it would represent the last four bits of the number.

## Task 2 ##
We were supposed to spin the motor clockwise and counterclockwise based on button presses. We had programmed four buttons: 1, 2, 3 and 4. Buttons 1 and 2 started the spinning and stopped the spinning respectively. Buttons 3 and 4 were to spin the motor clockwise and counterclockwise. If the motor was already spinning a direction, pressing the button corresponding to the direction would increase the speed. It would increase only two times.
