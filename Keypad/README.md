# Assembly Simple IO
In this assignment, we were given two tasks.

## Task 1 ##
We were supposed to read inputs from a Keypad and display it on an external LCD screen.

## Task 2 ##
We were supposed to read inputs from a Keypad and display it on a LCD screen but we had to use Finite State Machine (FSM) to do the transitioning between the different letters.

## Things learned in this homework ##
* How to use Mealy and Moore Finite State Machines (FSM)
* How to use Serial Peripheral Interface (SPI)
* How to display on a LCD screen
